What Iâ€™ve worked on: set up MNE library, load raw MEG data, combine 2 runs, read bad segments of the data
What problems I encountered: the plotting function of MNE is a bit stuck, the plot shows up but I could not inspect the plots well
What I learned: load and utilise data paths, get information of the MEG data, and plot the raw MEG data
Which resources did I use: MNE tutorials: https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/io/60_ctf_bst_auditory.html#tut-brainstorm-auditory; 
https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/intro/10_overview.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-intro-10-overview-py

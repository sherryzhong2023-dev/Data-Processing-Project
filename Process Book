What I’ve worked on: set up MNE library, load raw MEG data, combine 2 runs, read bad segments of the data
What problems I encountered: the plotting function of MNE does not work properly, the plot shows up, but I could not inspect the plot well
What I learned: load and utilise data paths, get information about the MEG data, and plot the raw MEG data
Which resources did I use: MNE tutorials

What I’ve worked on: change to a simpler dataset, inspect data
What problems I encountered: the initial dataset involves too complex use of the library, which feels overwhelming, so I shifted to a simpler dataset to get a better idea about the library
What I learned: inspect the details of the data, different usage of the channels
Which resources did I use: MNE tutorials

What I’ve worked on: begin analysis pipelines. create epochs on different stimulus conditions, plot out averaged evoked responses, and visualise differences between conditions
What problems I encountered: The topomap layout with the central head and surrounding area was confusing at first, but I learnt that it can be interpreted as a static snapshot of the activity across the scalp.
What I learned: compute and visualize evoked responses from epochs, interpret time-series and topographic plots, understand the meaning of the PSD plots, and relate them to brain activity localization.

What I’ve worked on: use cleaned data for evoked analysis, add analysis of epochs on auditory evoked fields
What problems I encountered: the raw evoked field averages for the left and right stimuli looked very similar. I learned later that the similarity is expected due to bilateral brain activation; it is the difference wave that is the necessary tool to isolate the true contralateral effect.
What I learned: ICA is a source separation technique used for noise removal, not primarily source localization.

What I’ve worked on: improved documentation of the notebook for presentation, such as adding more explanations for technical terms to connect the code for better understanding
What problems I encountered: ensure the scientific vocabularies and the abbreviations are clearly explained.
What I learned: my understanding of each step of the analysis of the pipeline was strengthened, and I have a clearer picture of the details within the preprocessing
Which resources did I use: MNE tutorials, google search, EEG tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmt89hHyxuM

Date of entry: 29 Nov
What I’ve worked on: continue to improve documentation of the notebook for presentation
What problems I encountered: ensure the scientific vocabularies and the abbreviations are clearly explained.
What I learned: going through the theoretical knowledge of EEG and ICA allows me to have a bigger picture of the whole analysis
